Replecate the design, 
using vue.js or your preferable Javascript Framework

1) If after 2.5 hours you didn't finish, stop and send the finished result
2) Make sure the design is responsive to desktop and mobile according to the Images attached
3) You can use any kind of material design such as vuetify, etc...
4) Make sure to use the data.JSON file added to the assets folder


Good Luck :)
